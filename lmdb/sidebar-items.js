Replace the item at the current cursor position. The key parameter must match the current position. If using sorted duplicates (`DUP_SORT`) the data item must still sort into the same position.

This flag must be specified when creating the environment, and is stored persistently in the environment. If successful, the memory map will always reside at the same virtual address and pointers used to reference data items in the database will be constant across multiple invocations.

If concurrent access is anticipated, the caller must manage all concurrency themself. For proper operation the caller must enforce single-writer semantics, and must ensure that no readers are using old transactions while a writer is active. The simplest approach is to use an exclusive lock so that no readers may be active at all when a writer begins."],["NO_MEM_INIT","Do not initialize malloc'd memory before writing to unused spaces in the data file. By default, memory for pages written to the data file is obtained using malloc. While these pages may be reused in subsequent transactions, freshly malloc'd pages will be initialized to zeroes before use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other code (that used the heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the data file. Note that many other system libraries may allocate and free memory from the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may use the heap for file I/O buffers. This initialization step has a modest performance cost so some applications may want to disable it using this flag. This option can be a problem for applications which handle sensitive data like passwords, and it makes memory checkers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed with `WRITE_MAP`, which writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for pages. The initialization is also skipped if writing with reserve; the caller is expected to overwrite all of the memory that was reserved in that case."],["NO_META_SYNC","Flush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the metadata flush.

This optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database or lose the last transactions if buffers are not yet flushed to disk. The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers to disk and how often `Environment::sync` is called. However, if the filesystem preserves write order and the `WRITE_MAP` flag is not used, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties and only lose D (durability). I.e. database integrity is maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions.
